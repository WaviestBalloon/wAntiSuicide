###### wAntiSuicide is my own add-on to prevent people from doing "kill" in console to get away from an player or just to minge.

This add-on is fairly outdated now but I plan to fix it up and even add some convars to make serversided toggling easier.
if the add-on is broken (because Garry's Mod) then feel free to contact me on Discord, you can find my username and tag at https://wav.blue/
