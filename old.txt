[b]The add-on will be much more customisable in future times but for now you can do the following:[/b]
- Turn on or off the Anti-Suicide (Which most Anti-Suicides don't have)
- Change the message printed in console and also in chat
[b]To come in the future: [/b]
- Change colour of the message in chat
- A GUI (So you don't have to extract the .GMA file)
- A warn sound (Plays a sound when they attempt to do 'kill' in console)

[i]How do I change the message?[/i]
[b]> To change the message you need to, 1. Extract the .GMA file or 2. Download the code via GitHub, GitHub is faster and not much of a hassle to use. [url=https://github.com/Waviestballoonx9/wAntiSuicide]GitHub Download[/url]
Once you got the file go to the following: [/b]
[code]w_anti_suicide -> lua -> autorun -> mainscript.lua[/code] [b]and then you should see the following...[/b]

[i]Why do I get this in my console?[/i]

[b]> This means that you haven't put either 'true' or 'false' in the config part in the code, here is a example:[/b]

[b]By default it's 'false'[/b]

[h1]Need help?[/h1]
If you changed anything that isn't the config then I will not help you, but if it is anything with the config or the addon then drop the error (From your console) into the comments.
